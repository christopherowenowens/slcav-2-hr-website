# A two hour website demo

## TLDR
I created this website, as-is, in exactly 2 hours, from 10pm to midnight on 2018-08-15. Bootstrap (responsive), loosely based on Start Bootstrap's 'agency' theme.

## The full story

In 2018, I was working with a number of bands in Salt Lake City, via running sound and booking shows at the Royal, doing video for uNreaLconcerts, and of course the long lived High Point Coffee Saturday Night Open Mic.

I was trying to grow my brand [in-tuned](https://in-tuned.com). I was considering hosting a songwriting workshop, and I met someone who had some experience in that area and could help. So we did a few meetings talking about what we could do to help each other -- I offered to build a website for his band in exchange for a songwriting seminar.

In the process, I discovered that his main business website -- slcav.com -- was down. Looks like his 'web guy' messed up! I brought it to his attention.

**When we met two weeks later, I checked and his website was still down!** Especially for being a high-ranking search result with paid AdWords campaigns, this was unfathomable to me.

In order to impress and win him over to get the bid to do his band website, I offered to 'rebuild' his website that night. I used an archived version of the page (which only had a few headings cached -- no visual, html, css, or in-depth content).

**I built this and published it in 2 hours.**

I also built demos for his actual band website (which I will publish here as well), but despite all the good faith effort put in on my end and a month's worth of meetings, he was unwilling to trade his songwriting expertise in a workshop, and also unwilling to pay (even though I start websites at $100, including free hosting).

I know when to cut my losses when dealing with unreasonable clients; it's an essential skill as an independent web developer. As such we parted ways. To this day, his band still doesn't have their own homepage (instead relying on Facebook and ReverbNation).

## Version 2.0
In December 2018, I then decided to repurpose this template, and use it for [my own professional website](https://ratm.io). I made a few adjustments including a video header (which I spliced together myself), and working on some additional integration (a blogroll in place of the portfolio).
